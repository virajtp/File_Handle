Handle a text file with mathematical formulas c++

A text file with mathematical formulas is provided and the result of each
formulas needed to be calculated using a C++ programme.

I developed a C++ console programme according to the following guidelines:

*Load the text file with mathematical formulas.

*Read a single formula at a time.

*Calculate the result of the formulas according to the BODMAS order convention (Bracket, OR
operation, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction).

*Print the result at the end of the formula.

*Present the result in floating point number with precision up to 2 decimal points.

*Save all the formulas and its results to a new text file, ‘result.txt’.

*If there is an error such as missing equal symbol at the end of the formula or imbalance
bracket use, or any other mathematical error, print ‘E’ to indicate an error.


Text file description:

*A text file (formulas.txt) contains couple of formulas with basic mathematical operations.

*Each line in the text file contains a formulas, which is less than 100 characters per line.

*Each formulas ends with a equal (=) symbol.

*Only integer values are included in the formulas
